# Rust

Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency.[16][17] Rust is syntactically similar to C++,[18] but can guarantee memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references.[19] Rust achieves memory safety without garbage collection, and reference counting is optional.[20][21]
